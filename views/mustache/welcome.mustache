        for rapid software development.

    <p>
        High Fidelity is an open source virtual world platform. We are
        building the software with a mix of full-time developers, part
        time developers who are paid here on the worklist, and open
        source collaborators. As use of the virtual world grows, Worklist
        will also host paid projects run by other teams.
