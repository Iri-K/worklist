<h3>General FAQs<span class="heading-links" /></h3>
<h4>What is Worklist? </h4>
<p>
    Worklist is a marketplace to rapidly build software and websites 
    using a global network of developers, designers and testers.
</p>
<h4>What does "Mechanic" mean?</H4>
<p>
    Mechanic refers to our distributed development team. Our global team 
    of mechanics include web developers, engineers, designers and UI/UX experts.
</p>
<h4>What does "Founder" mean?</h4>
<p>
    Founder refers to the project owner. They are usually the entrepreneur who 
    is funding the project and make the final decisions on what goes live.
</p>
<h4>Why would I add a project to worklist?</h4>
<p>
    Worklist is a marketplace to rapidly prototype and build software and websites 
    using a global community of developers, designers and testers. We're currently 
    working on several different <a href='./projects.php'>projects</a> and are always 
    adding new tasks and projects to the list. If you are an entrepreneur or software 
    engineer who wants to develop a new web or phone app, Worklist can help.
</p>
<h4>I'm a web programmer, can I Work on worklist?</h4>
<p>
    Yes! We're always looking for new web developers join our community. To get started, 
    <a href='./signup'>sign up for an account</a> or <a href="./github?action=login">login
    with your github account</a>.
</p>
<h4>What is a Bid?</h4>
<p>
    Bids are a key part of our process. When you enter a bid, it is always better to give a 
    brief description of how you intend to address the job requirements. Runners are not just 
    looking for the lowest bid; we are looking for a considered bid that has some thought 
    behind it and is not being unrealistic in cost.
</p>
<h4>What is a Fee?</h4>
<p>
    In addition to the initial bid, you will probably also see one or more fees attached to 
    a job. During the course of a job Mechanics may attach fees for code reviews, testing or 
    other help. We encourage Mechanics to use their best judgement when fee-ing in. If you 
    are confused about any fee, please don't hesitate to talk to the Mechanic before marking 
    your job as done. As a Founder, you are also able to dispute or even delete fees if you 
    wish. Founders can award bonus payments to recognize a Mechanic's job well done or for 
    going above and beyond.

<h3>Developer FAQs</h3>
<h4>what's the best way to geT sTarted?</h4>
<p>
    Join us in <a href='http://gitter.im/highfidelity/hifi'>chat</a> where there are almost 
    always other people around to answer questions and help you get started.
</p>
<h4>how can i locate jobs to Bid?</h4>
<p>Go to our <a href='./jobs'>jobs</a> page and select "Bidding" from the status drop down. This will show
you a list of all currently open jobs.</strong>
</p>
<h4>what is a reasonable bid AmoUnt?</h4>
<p>A bid is simply defined as the amount of money you will ask for completing the task described by a job write up. You can browse
 Worklist to get a good idea of what others have charged for similar jobs. When considering a task, be sure to carefully think about any
 problem areas or extra potential work before placing your bid, as your bid is considered an agreement between you and Worklist for any given
 job.</strong>
</p>
<h4>what is a fee?</h4>
<p>For some things, like code reviews or testing, you may simply attach fees to jobs, as opposed to winning a bid. For these
things, use your best judgement to decide what to charge and look through similar tasks to get an idea what others are charging. Take a look
at some closed jobs to get an idea how much others fee-in on code reviews and other small things.</strong>
</p>
<h4>can i view the source codE aNd/oR download it to my own server?</h4>
<p>Yes! The websvn interface to subversion can be found at <a href='http://svn.worklist.net'> svn.worklist.net</a>. Browsing the repositories will display
the path you need for doing an svn checkout or using an svn browser.</strong>
</p>
<h4>i tried to bid on a task And it said i am not eligible to bid, whAt's wrong?</h4>
<p>Before you can place a bid, you need to set up your payment information in your <a href='./settings'> profile settings</a>. You need to both add your Paypal address and,
if you're in the US, you will need to upload your W9 for our verification. </strong>
</p>
<h4>how do I obtain a sandbox?</h4>
<p>All code development is completed on our server. New developers who have had a bid accepted will automatically be set up
with a dev sandbox. Instructions on how to access the sandbox will be sent via email. If you have not received an email, check your spam or email contact@worklist.net.  </strong>
</p>
<h4>how do I set up my sandboX? </h4>
<p>After your sandbox has been generated, you will need to configure it correctly. Read how in our
<ahref='http://wiki.lovemachineinc.com/wiki/index.php/User:Sandbox_autoconfig'> Wiki</a></strong>.
</p>
<h4>on my first commit, i got an error that said i dO not have commit access, now what?</h4>
<p>Please contact an admin in <a href ='https://gitter.im/highfidelity/hifi' target='_blank'>chat</a> or email admin@worklist.net for help.</strong>

<h4>after I have completed my WorK, how do i get paid?</h4>
<p>Once you've finished work and it has had a functional and code review completed, you should set the job to COMPLETED.
 The project Runner will then need to verify it works in production and will then set the job to DONE. You will not get paid until this
 happens. Please view the <a href ="#ff6"> Project Status</a> flow for more information.  All payments are
 currently handled through Paypal. When you create your worklist account, you'll be asked to supply your Paypal email address. We will pay as
 quickly as possible after a job is marked DONE in the worklist (this is done by the person who created or is running the job).</strong>

<h4>who is eligible to perform coDe reviews?  how do i become eligible? </h4>
<p>Each project managed in the Worklist has it's own set of rules for Code Review eligibility.  The Project Founder
maintains these specifications. The Founder can select from the following options:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Anyone</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Anyone that is Trusted by more than 3 people</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Anyone that is Trusted by the Project Admin</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Anyone that is Trusted by the Job Manager</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Use only code reviewers listed below</strong>(Only specific users that the Project Admin delegates)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you meet the Code Review qualification, you will be able to start a code review by clicking the Start Code Review
button within a task.  If not, a hover message will appear over the biutton stating that "You are not Authorized to Code Review
this Job".
</p>
<p>To view the guidelines for a project, navigate to the specific project from the <a href ='./projects'>
projects page.</a>
</p>
<p>Trust generally follows completed jobs.  Therefore, if you do a really awesome job on tasks, Trust will come and so will Code Review
Eligibility!

<h3>Founder FAQs</h3>
<h4>how do I know Which bid tO ACcepT?</h4>
<p>Everyone has a slightly different philosophy for which bid to accept, but as a project Founder you have several data
points available to help you make a decision. First, most developers will include a description for how they would do the job, it's a
great place to start. 
</p>
<p>Another place to look is the Mechanic's profile, just click on their name in Worklist to view it. From the profile, you can browse all of
the jobs they've done, how many active jobs they have currently. Also, as Founder, you have access to "Reviews" from other project Founders
and Runners - don't hesitate to reach out to them if you need more information about their experience with the Mechanic.
</p>
<h4>can someone Else Help me Run jobS?</h4>
<p>If you would like to bring someone into Worklist to help you run jobs, please let us know and we'll help you set
it up. Also, we have several project managers on Worklist who have the ability to operate as Runners for your project. Email
contact@worklist.net for more information on how to set this up.
</p>
<h4>do i have to Open source My CodE to use WOrkliSt?</h4>
<p>In short, no. Open Source refers to a number of concepts, ranging from publicly available source code to a free
license to use that code for any purpose. For our own projects on Worklist, we allow our code to be publicly visible because this
allows us the fastest product iteration. These benefits outweigh the perceived negatives, namely that competition might steal our code
or that hackers will find exploits. Our code is not freely licensed and any unlawful use would result in the same legal action as any
other act of theft.

You are welcome to use any visibility level for your project. The trade-off for erecting tighter controls around your code is a slower
iteration cycle. Whichever side of the spectrum you choose to go, Worklist can accommodate. We're happy to talk to you to find a
solution that works best.
</p>
<h4>i'm not a Founder, but i'D lIke to be, how do I get my project on Worklist?</h4>
<p>You can add your project from our <a href='./projects'>projects </a>page.
Adding a project will automatically set up a MySQL database, Code Repository with a sample PHP page, and a Sandbox in which you
may add to and update your codebase.
</p>
<h4>how do I fund my project?</h4>
<p>You may add funds to your project with a Credit Card or a PayPal account. Email contact@worklist.net
with your project name in the subject to get more information.
</p>
<h4>how do I manage a project on workliSt? what do the variouS project Statuses mean?</h4>
<p>Tasks on Worklist go through various statuses from preparation through release. Once your project is up and
funded, you might need this cheat sheet to help you out until you get the knack of our work flow.
<p><strong>Stage One: Preparation > Setting up your jobs</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>SUGGESTED -</strong> Worklist allows anyone to make suggestions for improvements to any active project. When SUGGESTED tasks
    appear on your project, you can review and decide whether or not you'd like to move them into bidding.</li>
    <li><strong>SUGGESTEDwithBID -</strong> Sometimes when a Mechanic has a suggestion, they will also have a particular solution in mind
    and be willing to do the work. Don't worry, as project Founder, you always get to decide whether or not a suggested job moves ahead and
    who works on it.</li>
    <li><strong>BIDDING -</strong> As a project Founder, every new job you submit will automatically be set to BIDDING. You can also move
    SUGGESTED jobs you'd like to get done into BIDDING status. Once a job is set to BIDDING, any Mechanic can put in their offer. For help
    in selecting which bid you want to accept, check the <a href="#ff1">FAQ</a> for tips.</li>
    
</ul>
    <p><strong>Stage Two: In Progress > Getting your jobs done</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>WORKING -</strong> Once you've selected a bid, your job will automatically set to WORKING status. It will remain here until the
    Mechanic is done with the work.</li>
    <li><strong>FUNCTIONAL -</strong> When the Mechanic is ready for their work to be reviewed, they will set the job to FUNCTIONAL. At this
    step, your job as Founder is to make sure everything works according to your design. If anything looks wrong, leave a comment for the
    Mechanic to fix. If the job look good, set it to REVIEW.</li>
    <li><strong>REVIEW -</strong> REVIEW means the new code is ready to be reviewed by another Mechanic. If the reviewer finds any issues,
    they are either worked out in real-time in our <a href='http://gitter.im/highfidelity/hifi' target='_blank'>Chat</a> or via comments added to the job ticket. Once
    all issues have been resolved, the Mechanic commits the code and sets the job to COMPLETED.</li>
    
</ul>
    <p><strong>Stage Three: Finished > Your job is done</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>COMPLETED -</strong> Once your job to set to COMPLETED, the Mechanic's work should be finished. Depending on how your project is
    set up, committed code gets deployed to a staging site or even directly to the production site or both. As the Founder, you should
    double-check to make sure everything looks correct. If anything is wrong, contact the Mechanic ASAP. This stage allows Founders
    additional time once the job is live to verify the new functionality in production. If things look good, move to the final status: DONE!</li>
    <li><strong>DONE -</strong> The final Worklist status. Your Mechanic will not be paid until you move your job to the DONE status. As
    Founder, your DONE jobs will be picked up in our payment system during the next payment run via Paypal, currently twice a week. Funding
    for jobs under your project will come from your budget. Please email finance@worklist.net if you have any specific questions about
    budgeting or payment.</li>
    </p>
</ul>
<h4>can i control who reviews codE foR my jobs?</h4>
<p>Yes.  There are predefined options for each project (that can be managed within your specific project page).
That page may be accessed from the main <a href='./projects'>projects </a>page. 
You may select from:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Anyone</strong>(any Worklist user may review code)</li>
    <li><strong>Anyone that is Trusted by more than 3 people</strong>(any user that is trusted by more than 3 other users)</li>
    <li><strong>Anyone that is Trusted by the Project Admin</strong>(any user that is trusted by you)</li>
    <li><strong>Anyone that is Trusted by the Job Manager</strong>(any user that is trusted by the Runner of the task)</li>
    <li><strong>Use only code reviewers listed below</strong>(Only specific users that you delegate)</li>
</ul>
