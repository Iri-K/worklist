# Worklist: High Fidelity's exoskeleton for rapid software development

High Fidelity is an open source virtual world platform. We are building the
software with a mix of full-time developers, part time developers who are paid
here on the worklist, and open source collaborators. As use of the virtual world grows, Worklist will also host paid projects run by other teams.
